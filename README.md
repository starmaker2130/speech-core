#  Speech Core
## Custom speech recognition modules for AugR core functionality

The core modules in this package contain functionality for capturing speech encoded as audio data for use in decentralized immersive applications or DIAs. These modules form part of Lyoko's Conversational Programming Interface (CPI). Using our CPI, DIAs are written using natural human languages or through a synthesis of both human and machine languages, opening up a whole new realm of design phenomena.

#  MOTIVATION
To produce a truly immersive interactive experience for users and developers in the pARk, one's voice should influence physical spaces and objects just as it does in the baseline "real world". Interactions between human users (or analogous user agents) as well as between users and immersive variants of certain concepts like pets or assistants would require the use of speech recognition functionality.
