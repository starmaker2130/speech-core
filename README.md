#  Speech Core
## Custom infrared and multi-webcam sensor modules in Javascript and Lyoko for AugR core functionality

The modules that comprise this core package contain functionality for capturing speech encoded as audio data for use in decentralized immersive applications or DIAs. This module directly connects to the Lyoko interface that DIAs are written in using a potential synthesis of natural human and machine languages to open up a new realm of design phenomena.

#  MOTIVATION
To produce a truly immersive interactive experience for users and developers in the pARk, one's voice must be influence physical spaces and objects just as it does in the baseline "real world". Interactions between human users or analogous user agents as well as immersive variants of existing phenomena like pets or assistants would require the use of speech recognition functionality.
